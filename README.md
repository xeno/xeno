### 🌴 Life, Dogs & Side Hustles

Hi! I live in Mount Dora, Florida with my amazing wife and our pack of four dogs with a baby on the way.
Outside of code, you’ll find me out doing car stuff, making music or shooting photos.

I'm a *serial side hustler* who's never not building something — whether it’s a tool, a team, or a new way to automate the boring stuff.

### 🤖 Rebranding as an AI Automation Specialist

After 33 years in software engineering, I’ve leaned fully into **AI workflows**, **automation tooling**, and **developer experience**.

Now I help teams:
- 🚀 Launch faster with automated dev pipelines
- 🤝 Bridge AI with human-first UX
- ⚙️ Build smarter with Cursor, Windsurf, Bolt, Lovable and custom GPT integrations

If it makes things faster, better, or easier — I’m probably obsessed with it.
